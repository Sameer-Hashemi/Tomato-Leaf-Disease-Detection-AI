## 📝 Introduction
Plant diseases significantly affect crop yield and quality, with tomato plants being particularly vulnerable to various fungal, bacterial, and viral infections. Manual identification is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Objective:** This project aims to develop a deep learning-based image classification system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**—specifically **EfficientNetB0**—to detect and classify tomato leaf diseases automatically.

**Dataset:** We utilize the **PlantVillage Tomato Leaf Dataset**, which consists of 10 classes (8 diseases, 1 viral infection, and healthy leaves).

## ⚙️ Dependencies
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required. The project is optimized for Google Colab, where most of these are pre-installed, but you can install them using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow kagglehub matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
